# Tik Tok App clone

TikTok is an iOS and Android media app for creating 
and sharing short videos. The app was launched in 2017 
by ByteDance, for markets outside of China. ByteDance 
has previously launched Douyin for the China market 
in September 2016.

## Introduction
This is a basic mobile application that uses the flutter framework to 
create a clone of the [Tik Tok](https://www.tiktok.com/en/) App.

It was inspired by [BIGFIRE](https://github.com/yawboafo) my colleague, 
who built a similar [thing](https://github.com/yawboafo/Tiktok-clone) 
on iOS. 


## Plugins Used
The following flutter plugins were used to pull this off.

1. [Video Player](https://pub.dev/packages/video_player) - To help play videos from a server
2. [Cached Network Image](https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image) - To fetch images & caching 
3. [Image Picker](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker) - To help capture images from 
camera & picking images from gallery.
4. [HTTP](https://pub.dev/packages/http) - To make HTTP requests.
